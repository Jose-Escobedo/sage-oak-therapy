          What is career counseling?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-forest-dark leading-relaxed">
          In career counseling, professionals get to explore their relationships with their careers.
          There are various reasons why people can feel unhappy about their jobs. A question I often ask is,
          <span className="italic"> “Are you getting your needs met?”</span> Oftentimes people just work
          for the next paycheck, because it is what they are “supposed to do.”
        </p>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-forest-dark leading-relaxed">
          You start feeling burnt out, stressed, all sorts out of balance. Through career counseling in Los Angeles,
          you can begin to explore your values and needs at the workplace. You get to explore your skills and highlight
          your expertise. You will capitalize on your strengths so that you can be the best version of yourself at your job.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-forest-dark leading-relaxed">
          And maybe for the first time, you start to feel fulfilled in your career.
