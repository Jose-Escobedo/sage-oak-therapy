          You&apos;re capable, driven, and probably the one others lean on—but inside, you&apos;re tired. Anxious.
          Your brain doesn&apos;t stop moving. Even when everything looks &quot;fine,&quot; your body is tense, your chest
          feels heavy, and your thoughts won&apos;t let you rest.
          <br /><br />
          If you&apos;re here, chances are you&apos;re holding a lot. And you&apos;ve been holding it alone for a while.
          <br /><br />
          We want you to know: you don&apos;t have to carry this by yourself anymore.
          <br /><br />
          At <span className="font-semibold italic">Sage Oak Therapy</span>, we offer anxiety therapy in Los Angeles for people who feel stuck in
          overthinking, perfectionism, or emotional overload—especially those who appear high-functioning on
          the outside but are struggling on the inside. Our goal is to help you come home to yourself, gently
          and intentionally.
