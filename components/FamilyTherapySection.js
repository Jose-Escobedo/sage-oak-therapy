          What is family therapy?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-forest-dark leading-relaxed">
          Families are complex systems where each member plays a role. When one part of that system feels off,
          it can affect everyone. Family therapy offers a space to untangle these dynamics and build stronger,
          more compassionate relationships.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-forest-dark leading-relaxed">
          Whether you&apos;re navigating generational conflict, adjusting to divorce or blending families,
          therapy helps clarify communication and promote mutual understanding.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-forest-dark leading-relaxed">
          My role is to guide your family toward deeper connection, emotional safety, and resilienceâ€”
          no matter what you&apos;re facing.
