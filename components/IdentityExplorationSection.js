          Identity exploration therapy is a space where you can explore who you are—free of judgment or expectations. You may be
          questioning aspects of your gender, sexuality, culture, faith, or values. Or maybe you just feel disconnected from
          yourself and want to understand why.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-forest-dark leading-relaxed">
          Therapy gives you the room to unpack beliefs and patterns that have been shaped by your upbringing and experiences. It
          can help you find clarity and confidence in who you are, and guide you through moments of uncertainty or transition.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-forest-dark leading-relaxed">
          Together, we&apos;ll explore what authenticity means to you—so you can live more aligned with your truth.
