          Self-esteem therapy helps you explore and improve your relationship with yourself. If you constantly question your worth or feel weighed down by self-doubt, this work can offer a new perspective.

          We will unpack the messages that shaped your inner critic, highlight your strengths, and work toward building a grounded and compassionate view of yourself.
