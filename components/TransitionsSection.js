          Life transitions—whether expected or sudden—can leave you feeling ungrounded. Changes like moving,
          starting or ending a relationship, changing careers, becoming a parent, or losing someone you love
          can stir up anxiety, grief, or uncertainty.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-forest-dark leading-relaxed">
          Therapy offers a space to pause, reflect, and regain your footing. Together, we explore how this shift
          is impacting you emotionally and help you reconnect with your values and inner strength.
          Transitions can be disorienting—but they also hold the potential for growth, clarity, and renewal.

          Through support and insight, you can begin to navigate what&apos;s next with more confidence and ease.
